            <h3>Meet Brittany</h3>
            <p>Brittany is the founder of Stevens Collective and she married Dougie (the creator of this website). She has a deep passion to help moms create the memories they want. It's been her dream since childhood to mother children and, through her teenage years, spent a lot of time in childcare. Her passion for moms and children followed her into her photography work. She extends great care for every part of the photography process &mdash; from handling children and babies to picture editing &mdash; to ensure every mom and family happily leaves with physical memories.</p>

          <h3>About Stevens Collective</h3>
          <p class="wideContent">Brittany Stevens founded Stevens Collective in 2019. Although her photography experience was well over a decade before she created her company. Her idea was simple yet revolutionary in the digital age: people need tangible, high quality prints of their photos. After this idea, she honed her photography and editing skills to prepare to launch a photography company in Knoxville, TN. She contacted professional-grade print shops to ensure that every piece a mom or family leaves with is an artistic piece that they can hang on their wall. Her dream is much bigger for Stevens Collective. At the moment, she is in training to become a doula so she can provide support to moms and babies alongside providing stunning photos of the process. Stevens Collective will continue to adapt to best serve the needs of moms and families.</p>
